# NYC Citibank Analysis 
## Overview of the NYC Citibank Analysis
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines would be a great investment.  

Data from the NYC bike-sharing program has been provided which includes, data about passengers and trips.  We will use Pandas to manipulate the data and Tableau to show the complete analysis.

## NYC Citibank Analysis Summary

After completing our analysis we came to the following conclusions:
Majority of trips were under 20 minutes

- Two thirds of riders are male

- Thursdays are the busiest days

- 5-6pm and 7am are the busiest hours

### Future suggestions

For future analysis I would recommend showing the price of each trip and the number of miles of each trip.  This would help determine the revenue earned and number of miles each bike has travelled.
